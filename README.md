## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository. Open a command prompt and `CD` into the project folder
2. You will need to install/update npm if you have not already - use `sudo apt-get install npm` (or `npm install` if you are using Windows)
3. Run `npm start` - the application should open in a browser window. If not, open http://localhost:3000/ manually.


## Create React App
This project was built by modifying the Create React App template. From the Create React App documentation pages:


>For the project to build, these files must exist with exact filenames:

>    public/index.html is the page template;
>    src/index.js is the JavaScript entry point.

>You can delete or rename the other files.
